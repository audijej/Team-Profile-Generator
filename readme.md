## Description

This is a simple to use and convenient application that allows users to generate a simple markdown file. This markdown file can be a great addition to a repository's readme section. All that is required from the user is to simply run npm install, answer the questions, copy the generated markdown file, and paste it to their project. The simplicity of this application allows the user to focus more on the content of their readme file rather than how to create a framework for their markdown file.

## Application

-npm install\
-adding an image is recommended

## Usage

The user can use the application by simply running an npm install from their command line. Once installed, the user can then run "node index.js" and a series of prompted questions will populate the command line. The user can then answer the prompted questions as needed to narrate their proposed project. Once the answers have been provided, then application will generate a markdown sheet called "README.md". The user can then copy this markdown file and attach it to the project they intend to use it for. The user can then push this markdown file to GitHub and will and all the format will be reflected onto the readme section.
