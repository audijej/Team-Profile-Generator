## Description

This application allows a manager or supervisor to create a roster of their team members. The application runs from the command line and generates a series of questions that is tailored to the position that the employee holds, their employee ID, their email, their github account and their school. Once all the questions have been answered and the manager/supervisor no longer wants to add a team member, the input collected from the command line will generate an HTML file that organizes that specific team roster.

## Application

-npm install\
-Adding an image is recommended\
-Adding a CSS file for customization

## Usage

The user can use the application by simply running an npm install from their command line. Once installed, the user can then run "node app.js" and a series of prompted questions will populate the command line. The user can decide whether to add an engineer or an intern. The user can then answer the prompted questions that are specific to the team members role. Once the answers have been provided, then application will generate an html file called "team.html". The "team.html" file uses a series of templates within the program to complile the team roster. This file will consist of all the input from the prompted questions. Additional css styling can be added through the "style.css" file that is located in the output folder.
